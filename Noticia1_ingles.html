					<p> The source movie's most famous vampire movie portrays Vlad Tepes (Luke Evans) 
					as a victim of a Faustian deal, a prince of Transylvania who forms an alliance 
					with a creature of darkness to defend his people and his family hegemonic Turkish army. </p> 
					<p> XV century, Romania, Ottoman Empire ... All this sounds very distant American cine but 
					is only appearance. This <em> Dracula </em> is clearly a sense in Hollywood: read naturally 
					with violence, as if war were a craft like any other, but do not know how to deal with sex. The temptation 
					Beef is a central element of vampirism in Bram Stoker to Anne Rice, and the film's director Gary Shore ignores 
					this foundation altogether. 
					<p> As much as Luke Evans try, you will never have Vlad the weight of the largest Draculas, for reasons of principle: 
					The movie does not compromise the character of the violence (the Impaler killed thousands but at no time 
					this past proves a burden) nor undertakes with sex (Vlad drinks blood for practical purposes, he speaks of "thirst" 
					but never uses the word "temptation"). </p> 
					<p> If there is an eroticized fantasy this <em> Dracula </em> is only the fetish of the war, the grand demonstration of 
					Vampire powers of destruction. Again, the film does not compromise its protagonist: evil is a possible convenience 
					(armor kept under lock and key in a room of the castle) and the other is evil (Vlad is the only one that does not yield to instincts 
					primitives). </p> 
					<p> Phrase of the effect of (<em> "sometimes the world does not need a hero, but a monster" </em>), Shore can not make 
					This vampire its a monster indeed, that go beyond the physical deformations via computer graphics. It's a pretty uninteresting hero 
					in fact, Vlad Tepes Luke Evans, with his Christian sacrifice come ready to plant. </p> 
					<p> To consecrate the fetish of violence, something that comes from the factory ready here is the idea that <em> "everything is a game" </em> 
					as the character of <strong> Charles Dance </strong> says the original vampire, presented to start with <em> Dracula - The Story 
					Never Told </ em> a universe of shared movies with other classic Universal monsters. Behold the new Dracula: no trauma 
					and without conflict, the way to turn pawn franchise. </p>
